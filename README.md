# Assignment 2 Spectral Rep Reproduction in Pytorch 

Status: 
 - Spectral pooling complete 
 
 TO DO: Implementation of back propogation for spectral convolution 
 
The notebook spectral_pool_example.ipynb contains and example of spectral pooling in comparsion to max pooling implemented in Pytorch. 

In addition, it gives one example of a forward and backward pass of spectral pooling. 

Under src, the notebook spectral_cnn_pytorch_train.ipynb contains examples of training runs of the different spectral cnn architectures described by the paper. 

Implementation of spectral pooling and spectral parameterization are located in the modules directory.
